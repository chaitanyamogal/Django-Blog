# Django-Blog

Created Django blog web application with all features like :
<ul>
  <li>Signup</li>
  <li>Login/li>
  <li>WYSIWYG editor in django database</li>
  <li>Search</li>
</ul>

The frontend is based on simple HTML( i have used Bootstrap ). I also integrated WYSIWYG editor(ck-editor) in database.

 I have also provided requirements.txt file in case you want to try it <b>( pip install -r requirements.txt )</b>
